INSTALLING:

0.  Make sure that you have installed the complete source tree of
    FreeBSD including man pages and utilities. The supported versions 
    are: 7.3 - 7.4 - 8.1 - 8.2

1.  Install libconfig (devel/libconfig) package from the ports 
    collection.

2.  To install OpenLISP files in the kernel just run the
    "install-lisp.sh" shell script.

2.  Modify your kernel configuration file making sure that  
    the following line is present:

         options  LISP

 3.  The easiest way to install LISP is to rebuild "world", as explained 
    in:

    http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html
  
    Otherwise, if you can just build and install the kernel 
    (much faster) and then you compile and install the "map", mapd, and 
    "mapstat" and all the man pages separately. 
    This second procedure allows to avoid to go in single user mode
    and needs just one reboot.

    To compile and install your kernel please refer to:

    http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig.html

    To compile and install "map", "mapstat", and related man pages
    perform the following commands:

    cd /usr/src/sbin/map/
    make depend
    make 
    make install
    cd /usr/src/sbin/mapd/
    make depend
    make 
    make install
    cd /usr/src/usr.bin/mapstat/
    make depend
    make 
    make install
    cd /usr/src/share/man/man4/
    make
    make install

    In order to work properly, OpenLISP needs forwarding
    enabled. Thus, add the line 
    
    gateway_enable="YES"
    ipv6_gateway_enable="YES"

    to the /etc/rc.conf file. For more information please refer to the
    rc.conf(5) man page. 

    Then you can reboot your system.

5.  A good start to understand how to use OpenLISP is to
    look at the following:

        man lispintro
    	man map
    	man 4 map
    	man mapstat
	man mapd
