# Overview
The OpenLISP data plane (OpenLISP) repository https://github.com/lip6-lisp/data-plane hosts an open source data plane for LISP (the Location/Idenfitier Separation Protocol), a protocol designed at the IETF. This is a modified version of OpenLISP (http://www.openlisp.org/) to support new functions: load balancing, LISP Proxy Tunnel Router (PxTR), Reencapsulating Tunnel Router (RTR) and support for latest version of FreeBSD.

# How to install ?
For full guide, please refer to documents inside the source code. Following is very quick step by step to install a testbed OpenLISP (lines start with # mean command)

1. Requirements:
    
    * OS: FreeBSD 8.2, 9.2 or 10.0
    * Lib: Libconfig
    * Kernel source code
    * OpenLISP-0.2.0.2
    
2. Install
    
    a. Step 1: Install FreeBSD
	
    The ISO file and documents can be retrieved from http://www.freebsd.org/
    
    b. Step 2: Install **Libconfig** package 
    
    Use ports collection

        #cd /usr/ports/devel/libconfig/
        #make clean install

	Or use package management tools

        #pkg install libconfig

    Note: if **libconfig** does not exist in ports collection, you need to update the ports collection by following theses commands (take over 10 minutes, depend on the bandwidth)
    
        #portsnap fetch
        #portsnap extract
        #portsnap fetch
        #portsnap update

    c. Step 3: Install the complete source tree of FreeBSD including man pages and utilities Kernel source code if it does not exist. 
    The easiest way to install the full source tree is to run follow command as root, and then choosing Configure -> Distributions -> Src -> All  
    
        #sysinstall
    
    Or you can download the source code that matches the version you installed and unpack the archive to /usr/src 
    
        #fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/10.0-RELEASE/src.txz
        #tar -C / -xvzf src.txz
        
    d. Step 4: Install OpenLISP 
    
    Source code and documents (version 0.2.0.2) can be retrieved from https://github.com/lip6-lisp/data-plane
	
	From the source code directory, run the shell script to patch the kernel source code
	
        #sh install-lisp.sh

    Bellow is an example of kernel compilation. The full document to compile the kernel can be retrieved from: http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html

    +Make a new configuration file for a new kernel
    
        #cd /usr/src/sys/amd64/conf
        #cp GENERIC OPENLISP_KERNEL
        #echo "options LISP" >> OPENLISP_KERNEL

    +Rebuild a new kernel with a new configuration file
    
        #cd /usr/src
        #make buildkernel KERNCONF=OPENLISP_KERNEL
        or 
        #make buildkernel KERNCONF=OPENLISP_KERNEL -j n 
        
    replace n with n is the number of cpu you have to speed up the compilation process
    
        #make installkernel KERNCONF=OPENLISP_KERNEL
	
	Note: it could take more than 30 minutes, depend on the system

    e. Step 5: Installation of the OpenLISP tools
        
	+OpenLISP map: to manage OpenLISP mapping database
	
	    #cd /usr/src/sbin/map/
        #make depend
        #make
        #make install

    +OpenLISP mapstat: for statistical of OpenLISP
    
        #cd /usr/src/usr.bin/mapstat/
        #make depend
        #make
        #make install

    +OpenLISP man: man page of OpenLISP
    
        #cd /usr/src/share/man/man4/
        #make
        #make install

    Note: reboot the system to load new kernel, and use some commands to start with OpenLISP.
    
        #man lispintro
        #man 4 map
        #man mapstat
        #mapstat â€“Xn
        #mapstat -s -p lisp
        
3. Function switching

    Two new sysctl variables "net.lisp.function" and "net.lisp.xtr_te" have been added to OpenLISP to allow switching between functions and enable LISP-TE function on xTR. With "net.lisp.function" there are three available values: xtr, pxtr and rtr
